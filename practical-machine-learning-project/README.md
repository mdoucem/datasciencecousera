## Practical Machine Learning Project

### About Project
It is nowadays possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. The goal of the work presented in this project repository is to use data collected from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants and predict the manner in which they did the exercise. The participants were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website [here][http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har]. (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

### Source of Data
The data for this project come from this [source][http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har]. It includes two datasets:
Training data - https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv
Testing  data - https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv

### Aim
Explore the data and predict the "classe" variable in the training set, which corresponds to the manner in which the participants in the data did the exercise.

### Reporting (gh-pages)
The reporting of the analysis and prediction model is done in two files under two branches:
Master branch includes the R markdown file, .Rmd as well as the .html file
gh-pages branch specifically contains the HTML files -> https://github.com/mdoucem/datasciencecousera/tree/gh-pages
